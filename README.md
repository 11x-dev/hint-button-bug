***Hint***

If you found the file with the hint button (src/views/Lessons/Puzzles.tsx) and figured out that the React component looks fine, you are correct! 

The issue is that we are calling a method from the submodule that doesn't exist. With this knowledge, figure out a way to find the missing method, and then add it back in.
