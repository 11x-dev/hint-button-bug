***Hint***

If you found the file with the hint button (src/views/Lessons/Puzzles.tsx) and figured out that the React component looks fine and everything SHOULD work, you are correct! 

The issue is that we are calling the findBranchesWithWrongAnswer() method from the submodule code and it doesn't exist. 

Remember that the submodule in this coding challenge is coded in.  You can find the main submodule and the inner submodules at: https://github.com/online-go/online-go.com

With this knowledge, figure out where the missing method is, and then add the code back in.
