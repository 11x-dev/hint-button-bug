***Hint***

If you found the file with the hint button (src/views/Lessons/Puzzles.tsx) and figured out that the React component looks fine and everything SHOULD work, you are correct! 

The issue is that we are calling the findBranchesWithWrongAnswer() method from the submodule and it doesn't exist. 

With this knowledge, figure out where to find the missing method, and add the code back in.
