The real repo uses a submodule that is located at: online-go.com, which includes another submodule at: online-go.com/submodules/goban. Due to limitations in this platform, submodules are not supported, so the code has been manually added to this coding challenge. The main submodule is located at this repo: https://github.com/online-go/online-go.com

There are 2 bugs with the hint feature, and your task is to fix these bugs!

The hint button is found on this page in the bottom left corner: "/learn-to-play/8/problems/capturing/1"

1. Bug 1: Clicking the hint button only shows the correct next move (green squares on the board), but not the wrong next move (red squares on the board)
2. Bug 2: Clicking the hint button a second time should hide the colored square hints on the board, but nothing happens when it's clicked a second time

TODO:

Add a gif here and/or images showing the problem

Also show a gif of what successfully fixing the bugs does!
