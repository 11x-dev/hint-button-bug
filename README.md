***Hint***

If you found the file with the hint button (src/views/Lessons/Puzzles.tsx) and figured out that the React component looks fine and everything SHOULD work, you are correct!

The issue is that we are calling the findBranchesWithWrongAnswer() method from the integrated online-go.com code and it doesn't exist.

The online-go.com code has been hardcoded into this coding challenge. You can find the original source code and its inner submodules at: https://github.com/online-go/online-go.com

With this knowledge, figure out where the missing method should be located, and then add the code back in.
