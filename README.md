**Hints and Solution**
************************

If you need a hint or want to see a possible solution, navigate to this document [here](/Hints-And-Solution.md)

**********************
**Coding Challenge**
**********************

The real codebase uses a submodule that is located at online-go.com, which includes another submodule at online-go.com/submodules/goban. To ensure nothing breaks when those submodules are updated, the code has been manually added. The main online-go.com submodule can be found at https://github.com/online-go/online-go.com

There are 2 bugs with the hint feature:

Bug 1: Clicking the hint button only shows the correct next move (green squares on the board), but not the wrong next move (red squares on the board)

Bug 2: Clicking the hint button a second time is not hiding the green and red squares on the board

The hint button is found on this page in the bottom left corner: 

```
http://localhost:18888/learn-to-play/8/problems/capturing/1
```

**********************
**Requirements**
**********************

1. Clicking the hint button shows both green and red squares
2. Clicking the hint button while the green and red squares are visible properly removes them

This was a real bug from a real production codebase!  Feel free to use any resources you want on this coding challenge, have fun!
